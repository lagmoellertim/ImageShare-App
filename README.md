# ImageShare Mobile App

With ImageShare, you can transfer photos from your mobile device wirelessly to your pc using the ImageShare Desktop App.

  - Easy connection to the Desktop App using a QR-Code
  - Take a picture or send an existing image from your gallery
  - Material design and cross-platform ability powered by Flutter

### Intended Usecase

  - ImageShare is developed to work as a replacement of overhead projectors
  - You can run the ImageShare Desktop App on e.g. an interactive whiteboard to make full use out of the included features such as the integrated touch compatibility
  - Because of copy & paste functionality you can just move the received image to any picture or document editor of your liking

### Desktop App
  - If you want to use this software, you may want to check out the corresponding desktop app to show your images on the desktop
  - The desktop app can be found at this repository: [lagmoellertim/ImageShare-App](https://github.com/lagmoellertim/ImageShare-DesktopApp)

### Tech

ImageShare uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) - Cross-platform mobile app framework

So naturally, I also published ImageShare under the MIT License at my [public repository](https://github.com/lagmoellertim/ImageShare-App)
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the app.
